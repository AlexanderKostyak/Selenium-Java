# Selenium-Java
Selenium Browser Driver Demo

The wiki java script is a demonstration of the selenium webdriver API in JAVA that clicks a random wikipedia link every few seconds.
GetElements is an included tool that will download any reachable webpage and log all the webelements found in the console. You MUST link the path of the selenium jar file to your workspace in your IDE for the imported objects to be recognized.  I build this program in jgrasp.

Very useful API.  The selenium jar file is older, but still very powerful.  You will have to download the chromedriver for your version of chrome, the included chromedriver.exe supports chrome version 107.
